<h1>Web?</h1>
<p>I currently cannot launch a website , to be precise , i needed to cancel it.</p>
<p>That is because in my awful country, you need to be 18 and have a company to have a website domain???? <br>So this was kind of pointless.</br></p>
<p>But the plan was to launch the dashboard for all of your stats and everything.And i might still do it.<br>The website and webapp are ready , just need a domain and a company that i cannot have ,cuz im not 18.</br></p>
<p>If anyone is ready to buy domain and start it with me , im open for discussions.</p>
